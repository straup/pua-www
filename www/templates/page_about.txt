<h2>What is pua?</h2>

<p><strong>pua</strong> is a simple web application that <a href="http://www.aaronland.info/weblog/2011/05/07/fancy/#likeadog">shows you new photos from your contacts</a> from Flickr as they are uploaded and older photos when they are updated. It can also show you new photos that your contacts have faved.</p>

<a name="how"></a>

<h2>How do I use pua?</h2>

<p><strong>pua</strong> is just a web page, like any other. You can use it in any modern browser on the desktop. It also works just fine on the iPad and the iPhone.</p>

<p>If you're using an iPhone/iPad the <a href="{$cfg.abs_root_url}photos/friends/">photos from your contacts</a> page has all the magic bits that will let you save the page to the <q>desktop</q> and then run it as though it were a plain-old app in full-screen mode.</p>

<p>On the desktop both Firefox and Chrome have the magic bits necessary to view web pages in full-screen mode.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>When you subscribe to your contact's photos (or their faves) <strong>pua</strong> pokes the Flickr API and asks to be sent a notification when a new photo is uploaded or an old one is updated. <strong>pua</strong> stores a list of the 500 most recent notifications and then feeds them back to you when you visit the site. It also keeps track of which photos you've seen, from which device, to limit the number of times you see the same photo.</p>

<h2>What's up with the panda and the unicorn?</h2>

<p>Sometimes you might see the words <q>panda tickles unicorn</q> appear. That just means that <strong>pua</strong> has asked for new photos to show but there aren't any just then. When that happens <strong>pua</strong> takes a break and sends out the panda and the unicorn to entertain you until new photos (or faves) from your contacts appear.</p>

<h2>Why is it called <strong>pua</strong>?</h2>

<p>The site is named after an anteater named <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tamanduagirl/tags/pua/">Pua</a>.</p>

<p>It's fun to think of watching photos rolling past as being like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tamanduagirl/2418297150/">an anteater drinking fizzy water</a> even if the two things have <em>nothing</em> to do with one another, really.</p>

<a name="why"></a>

<h2>Why did you do this?</h2>

<p style="font-style:italic;">The first thing that you should know is that <a href="http://www.aaronland.info/weblog/2004/04/16/5447/">I worked at Flickr</a> for a <span style="font-weight:700;">very long</span> time. I don't work there anymore but I still think Flickr is magic so that's why I do these things.</p>

<p>Somewhere in Flickr's seven and a half history there is this absurd notion that's taken hold which says Flickr is only for <q>good</q> photos. In fairness, there are a few reasons why that narrative lives on: Flickr was blessed early on with the arrival, in droves, of people who take seriously the art and craft of photography; Flickr promoted the idea both of an Interestingness metric and an Explore section as a way to highlight even just a slice of all the amazing stuff that is uploaded to the site every day which had the perverse effect of creating <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dorkmaster/4857857270/">a Frankenstein leaderboard cult</a> and an unintended narrowing of people's expectation of what it means for a photo to be good; Flickr hasn't done as a good a job as it <a href="http://www.quora.com/Why-did-Flickr-miss-the-mobile-photo-opportunity-that-Instagram-and-picplz-are-pursuing">coulda-woulda-shoulda</a> keeping up with the pace at which people in their immediate social circles are taking and sharing photos (that shift, from nerdy minority to basically everyone, happened almost overnight with the arrival of cheap and ubiquitous data plans bundled with cameraphones) allowing itself to be painted in to a corner where it looks and feels like a capital-G gallery with all the unfortunate expectations that come with that designation.</p>

<p>But still, this insane measure of <q>good</q> -iness against which everything is judged gets under my skin every time I hear about it. Somewhere between <a href="http://www.penelopeumbrico.net/Suns/Suns_Index.html">the Hell of HDR photos of sunsets</a> (on beaches (with babies (playing with puppies))) and a barren post-modern world devoid of any critical interpretation lies the territory where most of us live our lives trying to eek out rare moments of beauty in the shifting shadows. Somewhere in there we make a meaning for ourselves that has its roots in how those images shape themselves to the big-little bags of history we all trail behind us while we're otherwise busy trying to be noticed. <a href="http://blog.flickr.net/en/2011/06/28/a-different-life-in-afganistan/">That is where the magic &#8212; the good &#8212; happens.</a></p>

<p>I read an essay recently about the chef Ferran Adria which was a bit of a fawning puff piece but there was one passage that caught my eye. The author wrote that Adria <q>is in love with the transformations you can force on ingredients to make them change shape and form.</q> Which is a nice way to think about why pictures are important, why they are worth the <em>effort</em>.

<p>Stewart said it nicely, way back in 2006, in his <a href="http://blog.flickr.net/en/2006/03/24/eyes-of-the-world/">Eyes of the World</a> blog post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That can manifest itself as art, or using photos as a means of keeping in touch with friends and family, <q>personal publishing</q> or intimate, small group sharing. It includes <q>memory preservation</q> (the de facto understanding of what drives the photo industry), but it also includes the ephemera that keeps people related to each other: do you like my new haircut? should I buy these shoes? holy smokes – look what I saw on the way to work! It let’s you know who’s gone where with whom, what the vacation was like, how much the baby grew today, all as it's happening.</p>

<p>And most dramatically, Flickr gives you a window into things that you might otherwise never see, from the perspective of people that you might otherwise never encounter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's the <q>as it's happening</q> part that's suffered until now due in no small part to the sheer big-iness of Flickr and <a href="">the necessary plumbing to make the broadcasting of photos in real-time possible</a>, at all. But here we are now and one of the things it makes possible is an even bigger window with which a person can look on the world. It's not rocket science: It broadens the opportunities to see more photos and to encourage the time and the space with which we might use them to create moments of poetry.</p>

<p><strong>pua</strong> is the evolution of a similar application called <a href="https://contactswhohavefaved.appspot.com/">Contacts Who've Faved</a> (<strong>cwf</strong>) whose starting premise is: I don't really care what an algorithm or even the majority of Flickr users think is a worthwhile photo but I am more than interested in pictures that my contacts, be they friends <em>or simply strangers whose photos I enjoy</em>, have fallen in love with. I add people as contacts now simply to see the photos they fave. <strong>cwf</strong> favours a minimalist interface &#8212; thumbnails and coloured squares to represent the user who faved the photo &#8212; because it's meant to emphasize, to make more inviting than anything else,  the form and colour and composition of the images themselves.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>pua</strong> takes that idea one step further and shows you nothing but a continuous stream of images, scaled to fill the entire screen, with their titles overlayed in big friendly letters. The funny thing about <strong>pua</strong> is that, because it is always on and sitting quietly next to me, I both see more photos than I normally would and feel less anxious about the idea that I've somehow missed out on what people are doing because photos that would otherwise fall through the cracks has a lovely way of bubbling back up as people comment on them or they are faved or even just have their title changed.</p>

<p><strong>pua</strong> is not about trying to drink from the proverbial firehose of everything happening <em>right now</em> because the only meaningful consequence of trying to do it is that you hurt your lips. It tries, instead, to be a gentle glimpse into the looking glass of other people's lives and what they imagine to be meaningful or <q>good</q>.</p>

<p><strong>pua</strong> owes a debt of inspiration to the work that the clever people at <a href="http://www.riglondon.com/">RIG</a> have been doing with similar projects including <a href="http://dextr.riglondon.com/">DEXTR</a> and <a href="http://shorttermmemoryloss.com/portfolio/project/romance-has-lived-too-long-upon-this-river/">Romance Has Lived Too Long Upon This River</a> and to <a href="http://www.revdancatt.com/">Dan Catt</a> for his work <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/revdancatt/5225472121/">making newpaper headlines fun again</a>. Chris Thorpe also has a <a href="http://blog.jaggeree.com/post/1358328904/glanceable-user-interfaces-music-hackday-and">really good blog post about <q>glanceables</q></a> (much as I loathe the term itself) and what we imagine is possible doing with all these spare screens that have already started becoming a constant presence in our lives.</p>
