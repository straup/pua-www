<h2>What is pua?</h2>

<p><strong>pua</strong> <a href="http://www.aaronland.info/weblog/2011/05/07/fancy/#likeadog">shows you new photos</a> from Flickr as they are uploaded and older photos when they are updated.</p>

<h2>Why is it called <strong>pua</strong>?</h2>

<p>The site is named after <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tamanduagirl/tags/pua/">Pua</a>, who is an anteater. It's fun to think of watching photos rolling past as being like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tamanduagirl/2418297150/">an anteater drinking fizzy water</a> even if the two things, really, have nothing to do with one another.</p>

<h2>What's up with the panda and the unicorn?</h2>

<p>That just means there are no new photos to display.</p>
