<p><strong>Okay. You're all set!</strong></p>

<p>It will probably take about five minutes before any new updates are delivered but once they do <a href="{$cfg.abs_root_url}photos/friends/">you'll see your contacts photos the next time you visit this page.</a> You can always check <a href="{$cfg.abs_root_url}">the homepage</a> to see the last time an update was received for one of your contacts.</p>

<p>Occasionally, you may see a funny message about pandas and unicorns. Don't worry! That just means that <strong>pua</strong> has asked for new photos and there aren't any right now. If the screen is entirely black that just means that it hasn't found <em>any</em> new photos at all yet. Like this:</p>

<div class="image500">
<img src="{$cfg.abs_root_url}images/pua_panda.jpg" height="375" width="500" />
</div>

</div>
