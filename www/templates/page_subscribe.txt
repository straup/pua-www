<p>This is the part where I double-check that you're sure you'd like to subscribe to {$subscription_type.label|escape}. If you've gotten this far it seems like a safe bet but are you <strong>really really sure?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Okay. You're all set!</strong></p>

<p>It will probably take about five minutes before any new updates are delivered but once they do <a href="{$cfg.abs_root_url}{$subscription_type.url}">you'll see {$subscription_type.label|escape} the next time you visit this page.</a> You can always check <a href="{$cfg.abs_root_url}">the homepage</a> to see the last time an update was received for one of your contacts.</p>

<p>Occasionally, you may see a funny message about pandas and unicorns. Don't worry! That just means that <strong>pua</strong> has asked for new photos and there aren't any right now. If the screen is entirely black that just means that <strong>pua</strong> hasn't found <em>any</em> new photos yet. Like this:</p>

<div class="image500">
<img src="{$cfg.abs_root_url}images/pua_panda.jpg" height="375" width="500" />
</div>

<p>There is also an <a href="{$cfg.abs_root_url}about/">about <strong>pua</strong></a> page that you may want to read while you're waiting for new photos to arrive.</p>
