Hello! 

Pua is sending you a form letter that contains an invite code so that you may log in to the site and start seeing your contacts' photos!

Pua is just a plain old web application so it will work in any modern browser. It's especially fun in browsers that can be put in to full-screen mode, like Firefox or Chrome or Safari on the iPhone and iPad. Like this:

	http://www.flickr.com/photos/straup/sets/72157626644282140/

If you haven't already read the "About" page it's over here:

	{$cfg.abs_root_url}about/

Your invite code is:

	{$cfg.abs_root_url}invite/{$invite.code|escape}/

You should only need to visit that page once. When you do you'll be bounced throught the Flickr API authentication flow so that pua may be granted "read" permissions to view your contacts photos.

There may be some bugs left in the mix (including a few known knowns like the fact that videos are not displayed properly) but otherwise it should be All Good (tm).

Enjoy!
